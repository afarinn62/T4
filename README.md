## User Story: SAP to Salesforce Integration

### High-Level Overview
As a PMO, I want an integration that allows updates from SAP to Salesforce. This integration is triggered every time a new account is created in SAP. When this occurs, an HTTP GET request is sent with the account number, after which the integration retrieves the full account data from SAP and subsequently sends this information to Salesforce's Create Account API.

### Technical Section

#### Triggers:
1. **Trigger:** Account Created in SAP
   - **Communication Protocol:** HTTP
   - **Data Format:** JSON
   - **Data Model:** Account Number, Account Details

#### Backend systems:
1. **Backend System:** Salesforce
   - **Communication Protocol:** REST API
   - **Data Format:** JSON
   - **Data Model:** Account Object (with fields such as Name, Email, Phone, Address)

#### Source systems:
1. **Source System:** SAP
   - **Communication Protocol:** RFC or HTTP (depending on your SAP configuration, if using OData its HTTP)
   - **Data Format:** JSON or XML (based on the data retrieval setup in SAP)
   - **Data Model:** Account Information (including fields like Account Number, Name, Contact Details)

### Handling Missing Information
- The user did not specify the data model details for the source system (SAP). Please provide the specific fields included in the Account Information data model.
- The data format for the source system (SAP) is also unclear. Please confirm if JSON or XML is being used.

### Flow Chart
1. **Trigger:** Account Created in SAP
   - Send HTTP GET request containing the Account Number to the integration endpoint.
2. **Retrieve Data:**
   - Integration receives the Account Number and sends a request to SAP to fetch full account details using the appropriate communication protocol (RFC/HTTP).
3. **Data Retrieval from SAP:**
   - SAP responds with the requested full account data in the specified data format (JSON/XML).
4. **Send Data to Salesforce:**
   - Integration takes the retrieved account data and invokes the Salesforce Create Account API by sending an HTTP POST request.
5. **Confirmation:**
   - Salesforce confirms the account creation and sends a response back to the integration.

### Acceptance Criteria
- The integration must successfully trigger when an account is created in SAP.
- It should accurately retrieve the full account data from SAP.
- The integration must successfully send and create an account in Salesforce using the Create Account API.
- Proper error handling must be implemented to deal with failed requests either from SAP or Salesforce.

### Dependencies
- Access to SAP APIs/endpoints for account retrieval.
- Access to Salesforce Create Account API.
- Proper configurations and permissions for both SAP and Salesforce to facilitate the data exchange.

Please provide the missing data model details for SAP to finalize this user story.
