To achieve the integration between SAP and Salesforce, where creating an account in SAP triggers a notification to update Salesforce, you can follow these steps:

### 1. Understand Requirements
- **Trigger Event**: Account creation in SAP sends an HTTP GET request containing the account number.
- **Data Fetch**: Use the account number to fetch the full account data from SAP.
- **Integration with Salesforce**: Send this data to Salesforce to create a new account using Salesforce's Create Account API.

### 2. Design the Integration Process
- **HTTP GET Listener**: Set up an endpoint in your integration platform or middleware to receive incoming HTTP GET requests from SAP.
- **Data Retrieval**: Once your endpoint receives a request, extract the account number and use it to query the SAP system for the complete account details.
- **Salesforce API Call**: After retrieving the data, use Salesforce's REST API (or another appropriate API) to create a new account in Salesforce with the fetched data.

### 3. Technical Implementation
Here's a high-level overview of how the implementation might look:

#### A. Set Up HTTP GET Listener
- If you're using an integration platform (e.g., MuleSoft, Dell Boomi, Zapier), configure a webhook to listen for GET requests.
- If building a custom solution, consider creating a small web service (in Node.js, Python, Java, etc.) to handle incoming requests.

```python
from flask import Flask, request

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/sap-to-salesforce', methods=['GET'])
def sap_to_salesforce():
    account_number = request.args.get('account_number')
    # TODO: Fetch account data from SAP and send it to Salesforce
    return "Processing Account: " + account_number

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(port=5000)
```

#### B. Fetch Data from SAP
- Implement a function that queries SAP for the account details based on the received account number. This can be done using SAP APIs (such as OData or REST) or through direct database access if available.

```python
def fetch_account_data_from_sap(account_number):
    # This is a placeholder for executing a query to SAP
    # Depending on your SAP setup this will change
    account_data = {
        "name": "Example Company",
        "email": "contact@example.com",
        # Add other fields based on your SAP account structure
    }
    return account_data
```

#### C. Send Data to Salesforce
- Use the Salesforce REST API to create a new account based on the data obtained from SAP.

```python
import requests

def create_salesforce_account(account_data):
    url = 'https://your-instance.salesforce.com/services/data/vXX.0/sobjects/Account/'
    headers = {
        'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN',
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    }
    response = requests.post(url, json=account_data, headers=headers)
    return response
```

#### D. Integrate the Steps
Combine all parts in the HTTP GET listener, handling errors and logging as necessary:

```python
@app.route('/sap-to-salesforce', methods=['GET'])
def sap_to_salesforce():
    account_number = request.args.get('account_number')

    # Fetch data from SAP
    account_data = fetch_account_data_from_sap(account_number)

    # Send data to Salesforce
    response = create_salesforce_account(account_data)

    if response.status_code == 201:
        return "Account created successfully in Salesforce!", 201
    else:
        return "Failed to create account in Salesforce: " + response.text, 500
```

### 4. Test the Integration
- Perform tests to ensure the whole workflow is functioning as expected. 
- Handle scenarios where there might be errors during data fetch from SAP or when creating an account in Salesforce (e.g., duplicate accounts, validation errors).

### 5. Schedule Regular Updates (Optional)
- If you need to keep Salesforce updated with other changes or periodic updates from SAP, consider additional mechanisms like a scheduled job or additional endpoints.

### 6. Security and Validation
- Ensure that your integration handles data securely (e.g., use HTTPS).
- Implement validation to check if the account data complies with Salesforce requirements before creating it.

### Conclusion
This architecture allows for a seamless integration between SAP and Salesforce to ensure that accounts are synchronized between the two systems. Depending on your specific requirements and constraints (like available technologies, access to APIs, etc.), you can adjust the specifics of the implementation accordingly.
