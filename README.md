## User Story: Integration from SAP to Salesforce

### High-Level Overview
As a PMO, I want to establish an integration between SAP and Salesforce so that any new account creation in SAP triggers an update to Salesforce. This integration should be initiated through an HTTP GET request that includes an account number, allowing the system to retrieve the full account data from SAP and subsequently send this information to Salesforce's create account API.

### Technical Section

#### Triggers:
- **Trigger 1:** New account creation in SAP
  - **Communication Protocol:** HTTP
  - **Data Format:** JSON
  - **Data Model:** Account data model

#### Backend Systems:
- **Backend System 1:** Salesforce
  - **Communication Protocol:** REST API
  - **Data Format:** JSON
  - **Data Model:** Account object model (name, email, phone, etc.)

#### Source Systems:
- **Source System 1:** SAP
  - **Communication Protocol:** OData/REST
  - **Data Format:** JSON
  - **Data Model:** Account entity model (account number, name, address, etc.)

### Flow Chart

1. **Trigger Incident:**
   - SAP detects a new account creation.
   
2. **HTTP GET Request:**
   - SAP sends an HTTP GET request to the integration service with the account number.
   
3. **Retrieve Account Data from SAP:**
   - The integration service receives the account number.
   - The integration service makes an OData call to SAP to fetch the full account data.

4. **Send Data to Salesforce:**
   - The integration service formats the account data as required.
   - The integration service sends a POST request to Salesforceâ€™s create account API with the account information.

### Acceptance Criteria
- Ensure that the integration is triggered by an HTTP GET request from SAP each time an account is created.
- Validate that the full account data retrieved from SAP is accurately sent to Salesforce to create a new account.
- Confirm that Salesforce reflects the new account data without errors.

### Dependencies
- Availability of SAP's OData service for account retrieval.
- Access to Salesforce's API for account creation.
- Proper configuration of the integration service to handle the HTTP GET requests and communicate with both systems. 

### Missing Information
- Please confirm if the communication protocols and data formats are correct for SAP and Salesforce, as well as the specific data models used.
