Thank you for providing a brief description of your integration scenario. Based on the information you shared, I will now generate a structured user story that encompasses both a high-level overview and a detailed technical section.

## User Story: Integration from SAP to Salesforce

### Overview
As a PMO, I want an integration that updates changes in account information from SAP to Salesforce. This integration is triggered each time a new account is created in SAP, which is notified through an HTTP GET request that includes the account number. Upon receiving this notification, the integration retrieves the complete account data from SAP and sends it to Salesforce to create the corresponding account via the Salesforce create account API.

### Technical Section

#### Triggers:
1. **Trigger**: New Account Creation in SAP
   - **Communication Protocol**: HTTP GET
   - **Data Format**: JSON (assumed)
   - **Data Model**: Account Number (unique identifier)

#### Backend Systems:
1. **Backend System**: Salesforce
   - **Communication Protocol**: REST API (assumed)
   - **Data Format**: JSON
   - **Data Model**: Salesforce Account Object

2. **Backend System**: SAP
   - **Communication Protocol**: RFC (Remote Function Call) / OData (assumed)
   - **Data Format**: JSON / XML (assumed)
   - **Data Model**: Account Data Model

#### Source Systems:
1. **Source System**: SAP
   - **Communication Protocol**: HTTP (assumed, depends on architecture)
   - **Data Format**: JSON / XML (assumed)
   - **Data Model**: SAP Account Data Structure

### Acceptance Criteria
- The integration successfully triggers when a new account is created in SAP.
- The HTTP GET request is correctly formatted and sent to the integration service.
- The integration retrieves the complete account data from SAP and passes it to Salesforce.
- The Salesforce API receives the data and successfully creates a new account.

### Dependencies
- Access to the SAP API for retrieving account data.
- Access to the Salesforce API for creating a new account.
- Proper authentication set up for both SAP and Salesforce APIs.

### Flow Chart Steps:
1. **Step 1**: SAP system creates a new account (trigger event).
2. **Step 2**: SAP sends an HTTP GET request containing the account number to the integration service.
3. **Step 3**: Integration service receives the notification.
4. **Step 4**: Integration service sends a request to SAP to retrieve full account data using the account number.
5. **Step 5**: SAP returns the full account data in the expected format (JSON/XML).
6. **Step 6**: Integration service formats the account data as per the Salesforce create account API requirements.
7. **Step 7**: Integration service sends the formatted account data to Salesforce API.
8. **Step 8**: Salesforce confirms the account creation and returns a success response.
