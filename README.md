## User Story: SAP to Salesforce Integration

### High-Level Overview
As a PMO, I want to facilitate the integration between SAP and Salesforce to ensure that account changes in SAP are automatically reflected in Salesforce. The integration should trigger whenever a new account is created in SAP, ensuring that all relevant account data is transferred seamlessly to Salesforce.

### Technical Section

#### Triggers:
1. **Trigger:** Account Creation in SAP
   - **Communication Protocol:** HTTP GET
   - **Data Format:** JSON
   - **Data Model:** Account number and other account details

#### Backend Systems:
1. **Backend System:** Salesforce
   - **Communication Protocol:** REST API
   - **Data Format:** JSON
   - **Data Model:** Account object (including fields for account name, number, etc.)

#### Source Systems:
1. **Source System:** SAP
   - **Communication Protocol:** OData or SOAP (commonly used protocols for SAP)
   - **Data Format:** JSON/XML (depends on the OData/SOAP format used)
   - **Data Model:** Account object with relevant details (name, address, contact info, etc.)

### Step-by-Step Flow for API Call:
1. **Trigger Event:** New account is created in SAP.
2. **Initiate HTTP GET Request:** 
   - Request URL: `<SAP_base_url>/accounts/{account_number}`
   - Method: GET
   - Headers: `Authorization: Bearer <token>` (if required)
3. **Receive Account Data from SAP:**
   - Response should contain the Account details in JSON/XML format.
4. **Prepare Data for Salesforce API:** 
   - Map fields from SAP response to the Salesforce Account create API format.
5. **Send Data to Salesforce:**
   - Request URL: `<Salesforce_base_url>/services/data/vXX.X/sobjects/Account/`
   - Method: POST
   - Headers: 
     - `Authorization: Bearer <token>`
     - `Content-Type: application/json`
   - Body: 
     - JSON object containing the mapped fields.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. When a new account is created in SAP, the integration should trigger an HTTP GET request to fetch account details.
2. The retrieved account data must be successfully formatted as required by Salesforce.
3. The account creation API call to Salesforce must be successful, resulting in the creation of a new account in Salesforce.
4. Error handling mechanisms must be in place to log failures when either the GET request fails or the Salesforce API call fails.

### Dependencies

- Access credentials for both SAP and Salesforce APIs.
- Network connectivity between the systems.
- Properly configured API endpoints in both SAP and Salesforce.
- Valid account numbers must be provided for successful retrieval of account data from SAP.
